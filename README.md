# Data Infrastructure with Terraform of E-Commerce Shop

## Overview

This repository contains Terraform scripts to set up a scalable and maintainable data engineering environment. It includes resources for data storage, processing, and analytics, with a focus on e-commerce applications.

## Features

- Automated setup of data lake storage
- Deployment of data processing clusters
- Configuration of data warehousing solutions
- Implementation of data pipelines
- Security and access management
- Scalable infrastructure for e-commerce analytics

## Prerequisites

- Terraform (version 1.0 or later)
- Cloud provider CLI (AWS CLI, Azure CLI, or Google Cloud SDK)
- Valid cloud provider credentials

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-engineering-terraform.git
   cd data-engineering-terraform
   ```

2. Initialize Terraform:
   ```
   terraform init
   ```

3. Customize the `variables.tf` file with your specific configuration.

4. Plan the infrastructure changes:
   ```
   terraform plan
   ```

5. Apply the changes:
   ```
   terraform apply
   ```

## Modules

- `storage`: Provisions data lake and warehouse resources
- `compute`: Sets up data processing clusters
- `networking`: Configures VPCs, subnets, and security groups
- `security`: Manages IAM roles and policies

## Example: Customer Segmentation for E-commerce

This example demonstrates how to set up a data modeling project for customer segmentation of a Shopify store to optimize sales.

### Infrastructure Setup

```hcl
module "ecommerce_data_lake" {
  source = "./modules/storage"
  
  bucket_name = "shopify-data-lake"
  region      = "us-east-1"
  
  tags = {
    Environment = "Production"
    Project     = "ShopifyAnalytics"
  }
}

module "data_warehouse" {
  source = "./modules/storage"
  
  warehouse_name = "shopify-dw"
  region         = "us-east-1"
  instance_type  = "dc2.large"
  
  tags = {
    Environment = "Production"
    Project     = "ShopifyAnalytics"
  }
}

module "spark_cluster" {
  source = "./modules/compute"
  
  cluster_name  = "customer-segmentation"
  instance_type = "r5.2xlarge"
  num_workers   = 3
  
  vpc_id     = module.networking.vpc_id
  subnet_ids = module.networking.private_subnet_ids
}
```

### Data Pipeline

1. **Data Ingestion**: 
   - Set up a daily ETL job to extract data from Shopify API and store it in the data lake.
   - Use AWS Glue or Apache Airflow for orchestration.

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Use Spark to clean and transform the raw data.
   - Join customer data with order history and product information.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Calculate key metrics such as:
     - Recency (days since last purchase)
     - Frequency (number of orders)
     - Monetary value (total spend)
   - Derive additional features like average order value, preferred product categories, etc.

4. **Customer Segmentation**:
   - Use K-means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their RFM scores.
   - Implement the clustering model using Spark MLlib.

5. **Results Storage**:
   - Store the segmentation results in the data warehouse for easy access by BI tools.

### Example Spark Code for Segmentation

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler
from pyspark.ml.clustering import KMeans

# Initialize Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("CustomerSegmentation").getOrCreate()

# Load and prepare data
df = spark.read.parquet("s3://shopify-data-lake/processed/customer_data")
feature_cols = ["recency", "frequency", "monetary_value"]
assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol="features")
data = assembler.transform(df)

# Train K-means model
kmeans = KMeans(k=4, seed=1)  # 4 customer segments
model = kmeans.fit(data)

# Apply model to get customer segments
results = model.transform(data)

# Save results
results.write.mode("overwrite").parquet("s3://shopify-data-lake/results/customer_segments")
```

### Insights and Optimization

- Use the segmentation results to tailor marketing strategies for each customer group.
- Optimize product recommendations based on segment preferences.
- Adjust inventory management to align with segment purchasing patterns.
- Create targeted email campaigns for each segment to improve engagement and sales.
